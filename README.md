# URL_SHORTENER

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erfanghorbanee/url_shortener.git
cd url_shortener
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -m requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

We use environment variables to manage configuration and secrets. You'll find a file in the repository named `.env_sample`. This file contains all the required environment variables with placeholder values.

**Hereâ€™s how to set up your `.env` file:**

- Copy the `.env_sample` file and rename it to `.env`:

    ```bash
    cp .env_sample .env
    ```

- Open the `.env` file and replace all placeholder values with your actual data. For example:

    ```plaintext
    ENV_NAME="YOUR_ENV_NAME"
    BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
    DB_URL="sqlite:///./shortener.db"
    ```

### 4. Start the Application

Once you have configured your environment variables, you can start the application by running:

```bash

```

Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.
